Finding Your Path
This CASHFLOW Quadrant book is important because it is about
finding your path in life. As you know, most people are programmed
early in life to “Go to school and get a job.” School is about finding a
job in the E or S quadrant. It is not about finding your life’s path.
I realize there are people who know exactly what they are going to
do early in life. They grow up knowing they are going to be a doctor,
lawyer, musician, golfer or actor. We have all heard about child
prodigies, kids with exceptional talents. Yet you may notice, these are
professions, not necessarily a life’s path.
